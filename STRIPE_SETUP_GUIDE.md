### 1. Create Products & Prices

In your Stripe Dashboard, create these products:

- Price: ‚Ç¨9.99/month
- Billing: Recurring monthly
- Copy the Price ID ‚Üí `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_MONTHLY`

- Price: ‚Ç¨69/year (‚Ç¨5.75/month equivalent)
- Billing: Recurring yearly
- Copy the Price ID ‚Üí `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_ANNUAL`

**Day Pass**
- Product Name: "TailoredCV Day Pass"
- Price: ‚Ç¨2.99 one-time
- Billing: One-time payment
- Copy the Price ID ‚Üí `STRIPE_PRICE_DAY_PASS`

### 2. Configure Customer Portal

Go to Settings ‚Üí Customer Portal in your Stripe Dashboard:

**Business Information:**
- Business name: "TailoredCV"
- Support email: your-support@tailoredcv.app
- Privacy policy URL: https://tailoredcv.app/privacy
- Terms of service URL: https://tailoredcv.app/terms

**Functionality:**
- ‚úÖ Update payment methods
- ‚úÖ Download invoices  
- ‚úÖ Update billing details
- ‚úÖ View subscription details
- ‚úÖ Cancel subscriptions (enable with confirmation)

**Products:**
- Add all your products so customers can upgrade/downgrade

### 3. Set Up Webhooks

Create a webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard:

**Endpoint URL:** `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`

**Events to Listen For:**
```
checkout.session.completed
customer.subscription.created
customer.subscription.updated
customer.subscription.deleted
invoice.payment_succeeded
invoice.payment_failed
```

Copy the webhook signing secret ‚Üí `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## üîê Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Stripe Keys
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... # or sk_test_... for testing
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_... # or pk_test_... for testing
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Price IDs (from Stripe Dashboard)
STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_MONTHLY=price_...
STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_ANNUAL=price_...
STRIPE_PRICE_DAY_PASS=price_...

# Your app URLs
APP_URL=https://tailoredcv.app
SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@tailoredcv.app
```

## üéØ How It Works

### Customer Journey

1. **Sign Up**: User creates account via OAuth
2. **Choose Plan**: User clicks upgrade button
3. **Checkout**: Stripe Checkout handles payment
4. **Webhook**: Stripe notifies your app of successful payment
5. **Entitlement**: User's plan is activated in database
6. **Portal**: User can manage billing via Stripe Customer Portal

### Subscription Management Flow

```
Free User ‚Üí Checkout ‚Üí Payment ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Pro Features Activated
Pro User ‚Üí Portal ‚Üí Modify ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Features Updated  
Pro User ‚Üí Cancel ‚Üí Portal ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Downgrade at period end
```

## üìã Testing Your Integration

### 1. Test Checkout Flow

Use Stripe test cards:
- Success: `4242424242424242`
- Declined: `4000000000000002`
- 3D Secure: `4000002500003155`

### 2. Test Webhooks Locally

Install Stripe CLI:
```bash
stripe login
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```

### 3. Test Customer Portal

1. Create a test subscription
2. Go to `/account` page
3. Click "Manage Billing"
4. Verify portal opens with correct options

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Management Tasks

### Adding New Plans

1. **Stripe Dashboard**: Create new product/price
2. **Environment**: Add price ID to `.env.local`
3. **Checkout**: Update `checkout.js` with new plan logic
4. **Webhook**: Update webhook to handle new plan type
5. **UI**: Add new plan to pricing page

### Handling Failed Payments

Your webhook already handles this:
- `invoice.payment_failed` ‚Üí Sets status to `past_due`
- Features are disabled until payment succeeds
- Stripe automatically retries failed payments

### Subscription Cancellations

Two types handled:
- **Immediate**: Subscription ends immediately
- **End of period**: Subscription continues until period end

Your webhook handles both scenarios automatically.

### Upgrading/Downgrading

Customers can:
1. Use Customer Portal for self-service changes
2. Cancel current subscription and start new one
3. Prorated billing is handled by Stripe automatically

## üîç Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Conversion Rate**: Free trial ‚Üí Paid subscription
2. **Churn Rate**: Monthly/Annual cancellations  
3. **MRR/ARR**: Monthly/Annual Recurring Revenue
4. **ARPU**: Average Revenue Per User

### Stripe Dashboard Analytics

Monitor:
- Revenue trends
- Failed payment rates
- Customer retention
- Popular plans

### Custom Analytics

Track in your database:
- Plan distribution
- Feature usage by plan
- Upgrade/downgrade patterns

## üö® Important Notes

### Security
- Never expose secret keys in frontend code
- Validate all webhook signatures
- Use HTTPS for all Stripe interactions

### Error Handling
- Your portal.js already handles portal configuration errors
- Implement retry logic for critical webhook events
- Log all Stripe API errors for debugging

### Compliance
- Handle EU VAT if selling to European customers
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Follow PCI compliance guidelines
